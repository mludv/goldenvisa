    <h1>
      Five years without audits for the Portuguese Golden Visa program.
    </h1>

    <p>
    4.5 billion Euro. This is what wealthy, non-EU individuals have invested in Portugal to buy their way into the EU. But who are these wealthy investors? No such information is available for the public. The program has been criticized for its lack of transparency by many voices and, in spring 2019, news from the Portuguese authorities reopened the public debate about the risks connected to this program.

    </p>
    <p>
    The Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Augusto Santos Silva, said to the radio TSF that the Portuguese Golden Visa program has not been audited in five years. No reports have been produced in more than six years and no data about the number of denied applications is available to the public.
    </p>

    <p>
      Transparency International, an NGO who deals with corruption and power abuse issues,  is one of the most prominent voices criticizing this program.
    </p>
    <p>
    “We asked the government to present evidence of the controls they do on Golden Visa investors. They did not provide evidence. We don’t know which anti-money laundering provisions are being made, we don’t have reports from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we keep asking for information that is not provided. The only thing the government should do is stop the program until accurate evaluations have been made.” said Karina Carvalho, executive director at Transparency International Portugal.

    <p>The Portuguese government, however, has not expressed any intentions to shut down the program. The authorities claim that the program is perfectly safe and it has brought many benefits to the national economy. The program has also found support from real estate agencies, law firms and consultancy firms that provide support and advice for the investors.</p>

    <p>Mafalda Martins Lourenco is a lawyer specialized in foreign investment issues and is working at Abreu Advogados, one of the biggest law firms in Portugal. In the past years, she has been working with many Golden Visa investors from all over the world. She firmly disagrees with those who think the program is vulnerable to corruption.</p>
    <p>“Maybe the program was vulnerable in the beginning, but now we have a brand new regulation concerning money laundry. It’s very difficult to abuse the program. With the new regulation from 2017, real estate companies have a lot of obligations: they have to identify the owner, communicate all the transactions they do and Portuguese institutions follow everything.”</p>

    <p>MEP Ana Gomes, however, has a totally different opinion about the changes in the program.</p>

    <p>“The authorities don’t perform due diligence. It’s the lawyers and real estate agents that profit most from the program. When people are interested in applying for a Golden Visa their lawyers need to report if they think that the money is coming from suspicious activities. But the lawyers don’t report this. I know this for a fact. They don’t know the origins of the money because they don’t want to ask about it.”</p>
