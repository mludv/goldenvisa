        <h1>Golden scheme for the rich</h1>
        <p>
          While much has been said about the difficulty of receiving asylum in Europe, one smaller, much more privileged
          group of the population is finding it a lot easier to get into Europe. Buying your way into Europe and the
          Schengen area is the thing to do for wealthy individuals outside of the continent.
        </p>

        <p>
            “It is a scheme for prostituting European citizenship”, says Ana Gomes, a Portuguese socialist MEP who has
            been working with this kind of questions for a long time.

          Several European countries offer a citizenship- or residentship-by-investment program, so called a Golden
          Visa scheme. A scheme that is widely known by the rich all over the world. A new emerging market of
          billionaires from around the world are buying second residency visas or passports to take advantage of these
          benefits. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality">
          The Guardian</a> calls it “It’s the must-have accessory for every self-respecting 21st-century
          oligarch, and a good many mere multimillionaires: a second – and sometimes a third or even a fourth –
          passport.” Portugal launched its own version of the Golden Visa program in 2012 as a way to get more money
          into their treasury. Since its start in <a href="https://www.sef.pt/en/Documents/Mapa_ARI_EN_april19.pdf">
          2012 to april 2019</a>, the program has brought over 4 billion Euro in
          foreign investment to the country and most of the money has been invested in real estate. A program that has
          been surrounded by rumours and critiques about money laundering, criminals and rich Chinese and Brazilians who
          spend hours and hours at the casino.

        <p>
          But who exactly are these people coming to Portugal and investing in a Golden Visa?
          That is something well hidden for the public knowledge. We can only assume that money for them is not a
          problem.

          In Portugal, once a foreign investor meets a certain level of investment they can make their application for
          the Golden Visa program. Once accepted, this grants them a Schengen visa. To continue to be able to access the
          rest of the Schengen countries with greater ease the Golden Visa applicant doesn’t need to relocate to the
          country, they only have to spend a minimum of seven days a year in Portugal.
        </p>

        <p>
          “The best place for the criminals who steal is to have it in our banks or in our real estates. They have a
          sense it is well protected here and that their money is safe here. That’s why they are investing in companies,
          in real estate and in cars”, says Ana Gomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to the success of the program there are now real estate companies who specialize in helping foreign
          investors purchase property in Portugal. An industry that is unwilling to talk to the press about this issue.
          Several attempts to contact many different firms were made for this story. They organize the legal side of
          getting a golden visa, and many big law firms now include Golden Visas as a part of their global business. One
          Golden Visa firm explained why Portugal was such a popular choice by <a href="http://en.delsk.com/project/detail?pid=105">
          stating</a> “there are no requirements for certificate of financial sources, no business background requirements, no
          educational background requirements and no language requirement”.</p>

        <p>On a warm day in Lisbon we met Mafalda Martins Laurenco, who works as a lawyer at one of the top law firms in
          Portugal, Abreu Advocados. The office, located in an old bank vault is minimalistically decorated with only a
          reception desk and some design chairs. The location is in one of the most popular tourist areas in Lisbon,
          Alfama. Mafalda arrives one hour late for our meeting because she had to finish a meeting with a Brazilian
          Golden visa holder, was having financial problems. Dealing with Golden Visa investors and clients is a part of
          her daily work.
          The people who apply for a Golden visa residency are mostly Chinese and Brazilian, but people from other
          countries are starting come as well, especially Emirates and South Africa. </p>

        <p>Because of the Golden Visa rules that state that you only need to spend a minimum seven days in the country
          per year, investors are not forced or even encouraged to remain in Portugal and contribute to the local
          economy and society.</p>
        <p>
          “Most of the Chinese people who got a Golden Visa don’t want to move to Portugal, they have stayed in China
          to live. They have only invested here. They want to have an open door to Europe for their kids and family
          members to be able to come here and study”, Mafalda says.
        </p>

        <h2>Transparency</h2>

        <p>
          Not everyone thinks that allowing people to buy their way into Europe is a good idea, however. The issues
          with the program have been brought up in the European parliament several times by Socialist MEP Ana Gomes.
          “The biggest problem is the lack of transparency and the due diligence”, she says.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fifteen minute walk from Abreau Advocados in the city center is where Karina Carvalho, executive director at
          Transparency International Portugal has her office. The NGO has been criticising the scheme and especially the
          Portuguese authorities from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>“We can’t make sure that the money isn’t dirty money and that they’re not doing money laundering in buying real
          estate. We don’t have evidence that the money is coming from clean sources, that is the problem.”
        </p>

        <p>
          That there would be any problems with the program now is something that Mafalda Martins Laurenco doesn’t agree
          with.
        </p>
        <p>
          “There were problems before with the scheme but now it is safe since we have new regulations from 2017. The
          real estate companies and the lawyers have a lot more obligations now by controlling where the money is coming
          from, and the process is followed by the Portuguese institutions more closely”, she says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karina Carvalho thinks differently about this.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Since there is no information about the procedure the only people with insight in the program are the lawyers
          and real estate agents who are gaining from the golden visa scheme. They claim that the system is safe but
          they don’t prove it and the Portuguese authorities don’t prove it either”, she says.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is mainly the lack of information from the Portuguese authorities that they are considering problematic,
          and especially the lack of auditing of the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program hasn’t been audited properly since the start, something that we think should be done every year.
          According to <a href="https://www.tsf.pt/economia/interior/lei-exige-auditorias-anuais-aos-vistos-gold-mas-ha-cinco-anos-que-nao-se-conhece-nenhuma-10796817.html">TSF, a Portuguese radio station</a>, for almost five years the General Inspectorate of Internal
          Administration has not concluded any audit of the granting of the golden visa.

 <h2>Portugal's Golden Visa</h2>
        <p>
          As long as you have a clean criminal record in your home country you can apply for a Golden Visa in Portugal.
          However, that doesn’t mean that you are not being investigated for a crime in countries other than your
          country of origin, whether or not you are living there. This means that if an investor left their country of
          origin after being convicted of a crime, they can then provide a police certificate from the country they now
          are living in so that Portuguese authorities won’t find out that the applicant has a criminal conviction.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are different ways to be eligible for a Golden Visa but the most popular one is to invest in real
          estate. The required sum is 500,000 euros or 350,000 euros if the real estate is in need of renovation. Most
          of this real estates that are being bought is situated in downtown Lisbon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mafalda says that one side effect of the program being so successful is the long time waiting for getting your
          investment granted as a Golden Visa.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Our program is the best one. But I think right now the main problem is that the process takes too long. The
          investors buy the property and thereafter it takes a year and a half or two years for the Golden Visa to be
          granted. In the beginning it was 15 days. This is because of the high number of requests”, she says.

        </p>

        <p>
          The people receiving these visas may be secret but the identity of many big firms helping people obtain these
          visas is not. By searching on the <a href="https://rcbidirectory.com/">Residence and Citizenship by Investment Database</a>
          and filtering for companies
          offering services for Portugal produces a list with companies such as La Vida, CS Global Partners, Austar
          Group and Henley and Partners. We took some of these company names and entered them into <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/">
          ICIJ’s Offshore Leaks Database</a>, a tool for finding entities that appear in the Panama, Paradise Papers, the Offshore and the Bahamas
          Leaks. Multiple of the companies names returned results showing hundreds of connections to “offshore
          entities”. This doesn’t prove anything for certain, but appearing in these databases is information that needs
          to be taken into account.
        </p>

        <p>
          While there has been trials in the Portuguese court and concrete proof that the program has been mismanaged by
          people with <a href="https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20190104/world/eu-golden-visas-in-spotlight-as-portuguese-trial-concludes.698386">high positions in the government</a>, the scheme still continues to run. The continuation of the
          scheme has those looking at the program worried that there are even more unseen negative effects. Karina at
          Transparency International Portugal says that,
          “Until we know how and what kind of measurement the Portuguese authorities take to control that the Golden
          Visa investors money isn’t coming from criminal activities and that it won’t be laundered in Portugal through
          the program we want it to stop.”
        </p>

        <p>
          In April 2019 the Foreign Minister August Santos Silva said there is no evidence in Portugal that the program
          has been used for illicit or criminal purposes. However, he did state that they have received a recommendation
          from the OECD to facilitate access to, and the sharing of tax information of Golden Visa beneficiaries with
          other tax administrations. How much more open the information about the Golden Visa investors will become, is
          yet to be known.
